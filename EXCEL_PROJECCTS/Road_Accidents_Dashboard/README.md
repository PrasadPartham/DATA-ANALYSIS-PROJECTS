I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and compare road accident data from the UK for the years 2022 and 2023. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of accident statistics, focusing on key factors such as vehicle types, lighting conditions, road conditions, accident severity, and location (rural vs. urban). It allows users to gain actionable insights from month-wise and year-wise comparisons, including an in-depth look at the differences between 2022 and 2023. The dynamic nature of the dashboard enables users to interactively explore trends, helping identify risk patterns and safety issues.

## Key Steps and Features:
###Data Collection and Cleaning:

Gathered official UK road accident data for 2022 and 2023 from public government sources.
Cleaned and organized the data to ensure consistency, removing duplicates, and addressing any missing values.
### Data Categorization:

- Segregated accident data based on vehicle types (e.g., cars, trucks, motorcycles).
Categorized road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy) and lighting conditions (e.g., day, night) for detailed analysis.
Classified accidents by severity (fatal, serious, slight) to understand the impact of accidents.
Divided accidents into location types: rural vs. urban to evaluate geographical safety trends.
### Monthly and Yearly Analysis:

- Used pivot tables to analyze accidents on a monthly and yearly basis for both 2022 and 2023.
Compared the accident data between the two years (2022 vs. 2023) to identify trends and differences in accident frequency, severity, and casualty rates.
### Interactive Dashboard Design:

- Designed an interactive dashboard with dynamic filters, allowing users to explore data by different dimensions (e.g., vehicle types, lighting conditions, road conditions).
Incorporated slicers and drop-down menus to provide easy filtering options for users to drill down into specific time frames, accident severities, or geographical locations.
### Insights on Vehicle Types:

- Analyzed accident data based on the types of vehicles involved (e.g., cars, motorcycles, trucks) and their contribution to overall accident statistics.
Identified which vehicle types had higher accident rates and were more frequently involved in severe accidents (fatal or serious.
### Lighting and Road Conditions Insights:

- Compared accident frequency and severity based on lighting conditions (day vs. night).
Examined the impact of road conditions (wet, dry, icy) on accident frequency and severity, helping to highlight hazardous conditions during different times of the year.
### Severity Analysis:

- Provided detailed insights into the severity of accidents, categorizing them into fatal, serious, and slight injuries.
Analyzed which factors (e.g., vehicle type, road conditions, lighting) were most strongly correlated with severe accidents.
### Rural vs. Urban Area Comparison:

- Evaluated accidents based on location types: rural vs. urban areas.
Identified accident hotspots, showing where accidents occurred more frequently or with higher severity.
### Month-Wise and Year-Wise Comparison:

- Created visual charts to compare accident statistics on a month-by-month basis for 2022 and 2023.
This comparison helped to identify seasonal trends and patterns, highlighting peak months for accidents and the factors contributing to them.
### 2022 vs. 2023 Insights:

- Conducted a year-over-year comparison to analyze trends and changes in accident statistics between 2022 and 2023.
Provided actionable insights, such as whether there were improvements in road safety or increases in accidents in certain conditions or areas.
