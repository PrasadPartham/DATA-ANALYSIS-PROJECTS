# Data Analysis Projects Repository
Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! ðŸš€

This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects across various tools and technologies, including SQL, Excel, Tableau/PowerBI, and Python. These projects showcase my skills in data exploration, data visualization, data cleaning, and building analytical models.\n\n

Technologies Used:\n
SQL: Database queries, data extraction, and analysis. \n
Excel: Data manipulation, pivot tables, charts, and advanced functions. \n
Tableau/PowerBI: Interactive dashboards and data visualizations.\n
Python: Data analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and machine learning models with Scikit-learn.\n
Each project is organized in its respective folder, with explanations of the analysis conducted, along with the dataset (where permissible), and any scripts or code used.\n\n

Repository Structure:\n
SQL: Contains queries, database design, and data analysis using SQL.\n
Excel: Includes Excel sheets with data analysis, pivot tables, and charts.\n
Tableau/PowerBI: Interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports.\n
Python: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.\n
