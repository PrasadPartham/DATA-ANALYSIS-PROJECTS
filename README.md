# Data Analysis Projects Repository
## Welcome to my Data Analysis Projects repository! ðŸš€

- This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects across various tools and technologies, including SQL, Excel, Tableau/PowerBI, and Python. These projects showcase my skills in data exploration, data visualization, data cleaning, and building analytical models.

## Technologies Used:
- SQL: Database queries, data extraction, and analysis. 
- Excel: Data manipulation, pivot tables, charts, and advanced functions. 
- Tableau/PowerBI: Interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
- Python: Data analysis using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and machine learning models with Scikit-learn. <br><br>
Each project is organized in its respective folder, with explanations of the analysis conducted, along with the dataset (where permissible), and any scripts or code used.

## Repository Structure:
- SQL: Contains queries, database design, and data analysis using SQL.
- Excel: Includes Excel sheets with data analysis, pivot tables, and charts.
- Tableau/PowerBI: Interactive visualizations, dashboards, and reports.
- Python: Python scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and modeling using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc. <br><br>
